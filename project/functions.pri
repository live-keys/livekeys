# This file defines utility functions for use in the project build


# A utility function to abbreviate the hassle of checking if a variable is
# initialized and setting it to an initial value if not.
# Note that an empty variable is already defined and thus will not be altered.
#
# First argument is the variable name ,
# Second one the initial value
#
# Example:
#
# clear(FOO)
# initVar(FOO, bar)
# message($$FOO) # yields "bar", since FOO was undefined
# initVar(FOO, baz)
# message($$FOO) # still yields "bar" since FOO was already defined

    }

# Example:
#
# FOO = bar
# printVar(FOO) # prints "FOO = bar"
