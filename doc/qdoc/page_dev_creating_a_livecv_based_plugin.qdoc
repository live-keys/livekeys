\title Creating a Live CV based Plugin


In this tutorial you will see how to use the Live CV libraries in order to create plugins for Live CV without the need to
recompile the code. Live CV provides the necessary links in order to create Open CV components compatible with QtQuick.

\section1 Creating the plugin

In the previous section I have shown how to include opencv libraries into a qmake project. Within the Live CV API, this
is done automatically by a qmake script you can include. I will show this a bit later though, once we have the plugin
set up.

A QtQuick plugin is a compiled c++ library with a specific method or hook that can be accessed by Qt. Whenever a module
is imported within a QML application, Qt looks for its name in a predefined set of directories. If the module is found,
Qt loads it and calls the hook, which contains the code to register all the modules items into QtQuick, then they
become available for use. So to set up this type of plugin, all we need is to set up the hook.

QtCreator offers a template project to build this type of plugin, so lets start from there. To keep this simple, we will
create a plugin that counts the number of non-zero pixels within an image.

Begin by creating a new project in QtCreator. Choose \b{Libraries} then {Qt Quick 2 Extension Plugin}.

Set up the location, and put in the name "tutorial" as the project name.

Next, select the compiler like you did in the previous section. The third step will ask you an object class-name, and an
URI. Set up the  object class-name to be "CountNonZeroPixels", and \b{make sure you set the URI} to "plugins.tutorial"
(or plugins.<module_name> in case you named the module differently).

This path will be required by Live CV when it loads the plugin. From here go to the last step and click Finish. You will
notice a project with 2 c++ classes set up. The first one is the tutorial_plugin class, which contains a hook method to
register all the plugin types or QML items once the plugin loads, and the actual QtQuick item that will do the pixel
counting. Now we need to set up Open CV and the Live CV API for this plugin.

To set up the API, include the \b{api/pro/lcv.pro} file from your Live CV installation directory into your tutorial.pro
project file :

\code
#tutorial.pro

EMPLATE = lib
TARGET = tutorial
QT += qml quick
CONFIG += qt plugin

TARGET = $$qtLibraryTarget($$TARGET)
uri = plugins.tutorial

include(<LIVE_CV_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/api/pro/lcv.pro)
\endcode

The API adds extra items that make the actual link between Open CV and Qt, like for example the QMat element which is a
wrapper for cv::Mat. Now that we have the project configured, we can start working on the actual CountNonZeroPixels
item. We're going to need to set up an input matrix, and an output value of the number of pixels, so we'll need the
following 2 properties:

\code
Q_PROPERTY(QMat* input         READ input         WRITE setInput         NOTIFY inputChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int   nonZeroPixels READ nonZeroPixels NOTIFY nonZeroPixelsChanged)
\endcode

The QMat element requires us to include the QMat file at the beginning :

\code
#include <QMat>
\endcode

Last, we need to add the 2 fields, setters, getters and notifiers, and we have the final version looking like this:

\code
#include <QQuickItem>
#include <QMat>

class CountNonZeroPixels : public QQuickItem
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_DISABLE_COPY(CountNonZeroPixels)
    Q_PROPERTY(QMat* input         READ input         WRITE setInput         NOTIFY inputChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(int   nonZeroPixels READ nonZeroPixels NOTIFY nonZeroPixelsChanged)

public:
    CountNonZeroPixels(QQuickItem *parent = 0);
    ~CountNonZeroPixels();

    QMat* input();
    void setInput(QMat* input);

    int nonZeroPixels() const;

signals:
    void inputChanged();
    void nonZeroPixelsChanged();

private:
    QMat* m_input;
    int   m_nonZeroPixels;
};

inline int CountNonZeroPixels::nonZeroPixels() const{
    return m_nonZeroPixels;
}

inline QMat*CountNonZeroPixels::input(){
    return m_input;
}

inline void CountNonZeroPixels::setInput(QMat* input){
    m_input = input;
    emit inputChanged();
    m_nonZeroPixels = cv::countNonZero(*m_input->cvMat());
    emit nonZeroPixelsChanged();
}
\endcode

In the setInput method, we calculate the non zero pixels using the cv::CountNonZero method from Open CV. To
retrieve the actual cv::Mat contents of a QMat, we use the cvMat() getter, which retrieves a pointer to a cv::Mat
object.

We can now build the library and link it with Live CV. Press \b{CTRL + B} in QtCreator to build the lib. Go to the
\b{plugins} directory in Live CVs installation path, and create a directory called "tutorial". Copy the generated lib,
together with the \b{qmldir} file, which you can find either where your library was built, or in the source directory.
You're going to have a structure similar to the other plugins found in that directory. Run livecv.exe, and use the
following code to test your plugin:

\code
import 'lcvcore' 1.0
import "lcvimgproc" 1.0
import "tutorial" 1.0

Grid{

    columns : 2

    property string imagePath : codeDocument.path + 'tutorial.jpg'

    ImRead{
        id : imgSource
        file : parent.imagePath
    }

    Canny{
        id : canny
        input: imgSource.output
        threshold1 : 70
        threshold2 : 210
    }

    CountNonZeroPixels{
        id : count
        input : canny.output
    }

    Text{
        color : "#fff"
        text : count.nonZeroPixels
    }

}
\endcode

Configure the imagePath property to open an image on your hard drive. If you see a text just below your image with
a large number, then you have succesfully created a Live CV plugin that counts the number of non zero pixels in an
image.
