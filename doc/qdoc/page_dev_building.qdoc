\title Building Live CV


All modules of Live CV are available through qmake projects. To compile Live CV you need to have Qt 5.2 or a newer
version and Open CV, where recommended would at least version 2.4. The project can be opened up in QtCreator and
build, or qmake can be used directly on the main project file \b{livecv.pro}. The config.pro file holds the main
configuration for each Live CV module. You can have a look and configure it according to your system. Currently, the
only supported and required configuration is for Live CV to find the lib, bin and include paths of Open CV library.

For linux in general this does not require any configuration. For windows, 4 parameters are required to be configured
within the following variables :

\code
PATH_OPENCV_INCLUDE
PATH_OPENCV_LIBRARIES
PATH_OPENCV_DLLS
VERSION_OPENCV
\endcode

where \b{PATH_OPENCV_INCLUDE} is the path to open cv's include directory, \b{PATH_OPENCV_LIBRARIES} is the path to
open cv's libraries and \b{PATH_OPENCV_DLLS} is the path to open cv's dll files. The \b{VERSION_OPENCV} parameter
requires the actual version of Open CV.

\section1 Module Organization

The application modules can be split into 3 categories :

\list
\li The application module, which contains the actual Live CV interface and import features
\li The lcvlib module, or the API, which contains the code necessary to link between Open CVs elements and QML itemss.
\li The rest of the modules, which basically wrap around Open Cv's functionality
\endlist

In order to add new components to Live CV's code, the main focus is on using the lcvlib module. The module is documented
within the API section of the \l{Index}{index} page. Internal modules to Live CV's source are added similarly as one
would use the Live CV API to add external ones.

Its also interesting to note that the Live CV application is only plugin based, so by default if no Open CV imports are
made, the application can run independently of any Open CV module. The lcvlib is only used by Open CV modules, so the
lib itself is not required for running the application either. This means that modules independent of Open CV can be
implemented, and the application can be shipped with a different set of dlls than the current Open CV ones.
