/*! \brief Add support for a pointer on owning graph for primitive (either a node, edge or group).
 *
 * \note The pointer on graph is intentionally a raw pointer to avoid any "smart pointer overhead". Moreover,
 * GTpo is inherently designed to be used from Qt/QML who is not managing memory with std::make_shared, hence,
 * using a std::weak_ptr or inheriting graph from std::enable_shared_from_this would be a nonsense...
