# Welcome to Livekeys

**Let's dive in a quick tour of the workspace**.

Throghout this page, you will find 2 types of interactions that will help:

 * [Hover areas]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#logo;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#logo})
 help you localise points of interest within the application when you place your mouse over them. This one, for example, will highlight the Livekeys logo.
 
 * [Click areas](livekeys://open/resources/ClickedMessage.qml) will trigger actions when you click on them.
 This one will open a popup message.

## The workspace

The workspace area is split into 2 main sections:

 * [The header]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#header;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#header})
 * [The pane area]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#pane-area;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#pane-area})

In the left part of the header, you will find the buttons to manage your projects and livekeys configuration:

 * [New project]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#new-project;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#new-project}). Creates a new empty project.
 * [Save file as]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#save-file-as;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#save-file-as}). Saves the current editing file as a new file.
 * [Open project file]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#open-project-file;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#open-project-file}). Opens a file as a new project.
 * [Open project folder]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#open-project-folder;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#open-project-folder}). Opens a folder as a project.
 * [Log view]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#log-view;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#log-view}). View error messages, warnings and other information coming from your project.
 * [Run command]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#command-view;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#command-view}). Search and run available commands in Livekeys.
 * [Change settings]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#settings-view;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#settings-view}). View and edit the settings file.
 * [Manage licenses]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#license-view;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#license-view}). Manage licenses for different plugins.

The right part of the header shows the [active file]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#active-file;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#active-file}) (or main file) used by the project. A project can have more than one file,
and users are free to organize the project structure depending on what they need. We will cover these in detail later.

Below the header you will find the [pane area]({livekeys-hover:livekeys://open/resources/MenuIconHighlight.qml#pane-area;livekeys://open/resources/MenuRemoveHighlight.qml#pane-area}), a customizable workspace where you can open, close and manage different types of
views depending on what you are looking to achieve.

Currently, the only opened pane is this one, the documentation pane.

We will cover more about this in the second tutorial, where we build our first application.
