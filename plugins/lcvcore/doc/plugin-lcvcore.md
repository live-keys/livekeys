# Plugin `lcvcore`

This module contains all the main qml elements for Livekeys's computer vision code. In comparison to opencv, it is an
actual merge between the core and highgui modules.

```js
import lcvcore 1.0
```

{plugin:lcvcore}
{qmlSummary:lcvcore}


{qmlType:Mat}
{qmlInherits:base#Shared}
{qmlBrief:Main matrix object with variable types.}

  You can access a matrix's pixels from QML by using the buffer() function, which gives you a js ArrayBuffer. Here's a
  how you can access pixel values from a RGB matrix.

```qml
ImRead{
    id : src
    file : project.path + '/sample.jpg'
    Component.onCompleted : {
       var buffer     = output.buffer()
       var size       = output.dimensions()
       var channels   = output.channels()
       var bufferview = new Uint8Array(buffer)
       for ( var i = 0; i < size.height; ++i ){
           for ( var j = 0; j < size.width; ++j ){
               var b = bufferview[i * size.width + j * channels + 0]; // get the blue channel
               var g = bufferview[i * size.width + j * channels + 1]; // get the green channel
               var r = bufferview[i * size.width + j * channels + 2]; // get the red channel
           }
       }
    }
}
```

To read the image, all you need is to specify the location :

```qml
ImRead{
    file : 'sample.jpg'

}

```

{qmlType:MatDisplay}
{qmlInherits: Item}
{qmlBrief: Simple matrix display element.}

  This type serves as a base for all other livekeys types that require displaying a matrix, which is available in its
  output property. You can choose wether smoothing occurs when scaling the image for display by enabling linear

{qmlMethod:saveImage(string file, Mat image)}

Save the `image` to a `file` path.

{qmlType:MatDisplay}
{qmlInherits:external.QtQuick#Item}
{qmlBrief: Simple matrix display element.}

  This type serves as a base for all other types that want to display a matrix, exposed in its
  `output` property. You can choose wether smoothing occurs when scaling the image by enabling linear
  filtering.

{qmlProperty: Mat MatDisplay output}

  This property holds the output element to display on screen.

{qmlProperty: bool MatDisplay linearFilter}

  If set to `true`, linear filtering will occur when scaling the image on the screen. Default value is `true`.

{qmlType:MatFilter}
{qmlInherits:lcvcore#MatDisplay}
{qmlBrief:Base filter for processing images.}

  Inherits the `MatDisplay` type in order to display a `Mat` through it's `output` property, which is the result of
  processing the `input`. This class doesn't have any processing implemented, however it serves as a base type for most
  transformations within lcv plugins.

{qmlProperty:Mat input}

  Input matrix to apply the filter to.

{qmlType:MatRoi}
{qmlInherits:lcvcore#MatFilter}
{qmlBrief:Selects a region of interest (ROI)}

Selects a region from an image for further processing. The 'PanAndZoom' component shows how to use a MatRoi to select
a region from an image, then use a MatRead to read the regions values.

See __*samples/imgproc/panandzoom.qml*__

{qmlProperty:int regionX}

The x coordinate of the most top-left point of the region.

{qmlProperty:int regionY}

The y coordinate of the most top-left point of the region.

{qmlProperty:int regionWidth}

{qmlType:MatRead}
{qmlInherits:external.QtQuick#Item}

Reads an image's values and displays them on the screen in the form of a grid. See the `PanAndZoom` component for more
details.

 See __*samples/imgproc/panandzoom.qml*__

An alternative to the given example is to use a flickable area and use the `MatRead` over a whole image.

{qmlProperty:int input}

Input matrix to read.

{qmlProperty:Font font}

Font to use when displaying values. Default is "Courier New" with 12 pixel size.
 
{qmlProperty:Color color}

Color of the displayed values

{qmlProperty:int numberWidth}

Number of digits to display for each number. Default is 3.

{qmlProperty:bool squareCell}

When enabled, each number cell will be resized to a square shape. This is useful if you want to display pixels
together with their values. Default is false.

{qmlType:MatBuffer}
{qmlInherits:lcvcore#MatDisplay}
{qmlBrief:Keeps the previous frame.}

The MatBuffer type is useful when it comes to video playback and you need to keep reference to a previous frame. The
buffer stores the frame for next usage, so by it's output you actually get the last frame that was passed around in
the application. It comes in handy in frame differences, as in the example under
__*samples/imgproc/framedifference.qml*__

{qmlProperty:Mat input}

Input matrix to store. Whenever a new input is given, the previous one becomes available as output.

{qmlType:CamCapture}

{qmlBrief:Captures frames from a connected camera. This is a _**static item**_.}

An example of how to use the cam capture can be found in _**samples/core/camcapture.qml**_.

{qmlProperty:string Device}

This property holds the url to the camera device to be accessed.

{qmlProperty:size resolution}

Stores the resolution for this cam capture.

{qmlProperty:real fps}

By default, this is initialized with the camera's given fps. You can change this value if you want faster/slower
capture playback, however, setting it faster than the actual camera permits will limit to the camera's maximum
rate. This value is not absolute, in fact it depends on a lot of factors like processing time done by Livekeys and
speed by which frames are delivered.

{qmlmethod:CamCapture::staticLoad(string device, size resolution)}

This is an overloaded method for CamCapture staticLoad

{qmlMethod:CamCapture staticLoad(string device,size resolution)}

Loads the CamCaptures state, where `device` can be either a link or a device number. The device number should be given
in string form. Usually a default webcam can be accesed by '0'. `Resolution` is optional and stores the
resolution at which to open the capture.

{qmlProperty:bool paused}

This property can be set to true or false, depending if you want to freeze or continue capturing frames from the camera.


{qmlType:VideoCapture}
{qmlInherits:external.QtQuick#Item}
{qmlBrief:Captures frames from video files.This is a _**static item**_.}

The VideoCapture constantly grabes frames from a video file. The frames are captured at a speed equal to the video's
fps, but that is not necessarily to be considered as an absolute value. The speed can be altered manually by
configuring the fps parameter. A progress bar and a play/pause button can be attached by using the
[VideoControls](qml:lcvcore#VideoControls) type.

The first example in core/videocapture_simple.qml shows a simple video frame grabber, while the second one in
core/videocapture_controls.qml shows the grabber with the VideoControls attached.

* __*samples/core/videocapture_simple.qml*__

* __*samples/core/videocapture_controls.qml*__

{qmlProperty:Mat output}

Output frame.

{qmlProperty:bool linearFilter}

Perform linear filtering when scaling the matrix to be displayed. The default value is `true`.

{qmlProperty:float fps}

By default, this is initialized with the video files fps. You can change this value if you want faster/slower
capture playback.

{qmlProperty:bool loop}

If enabled, the video will start over once it's reach the end. By default, this value is `false`.

{qmlProperty:int CurrentFrame}

This property holds the current frame number. If you set this manually, you perform a seek to the specified frame
number in the video.

{qmlMethod:seek(int frame)}

Perform a seek to the specified [frame]() number.

{qmlProperty:string file}

This property holds the url to the file thats opened.

{qmlMethod:staticOpen(string file)}

This is an overloaded method for VideoCapture staticLoad

{qmlMethod:staticLoad(string file)}

Loads the VideoCapture state. `file` is a link to the file to be opened. This also acts a a state identifier.

{qmlProperty:bool paused}

Pause or play the video.

{qmlType:AlphaMerge}
{qmlInherits:lcvcore#MatFilter}
{qmlBrief:Merges an alpha channel to a matrix.}

Alpha merge is used to merge an alpha channel to a 1 or 3 channel matrix. The alpha channel is a single channel image
or mask that is loaded within the mask property of this class.

In the sample at samples/imgproc/alphamerge.qml a loaded image is merged with a drawn circle.

See **samples/imgproc/alphamerge.qml**

{qmlProperty:Mat mask}

Mask to merge the input with.

{qmlType:AbsDiff}
{qmlInherits:lcvcore#MatFilter}
{qmlBrief:Performs an absolute difference between two matrixes.}

The example in **samples/imgproc/framedifference.qml** shows differentiating two consecutive frames in a video to
calculate the motion. It uses a MatBuffer to store the previous frame:

**imgproc/framedifference.qml**

{qmlProperty:Mat input2}

{qmlType:MatLoader}
{qmlInherits:external.QtQuick#item}

 * `h` : height of the matrix
 * `ch` : no of channels for the matrix
 * `type` : matrix type
 * `color` : background color
